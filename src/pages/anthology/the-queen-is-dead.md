year: "2019"

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;A boy dashed through the rain, holding his jacket above his head. <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;_I’m going to be late!_<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;He relaxed when he saw Sun Yat-sen staring down at him with eyes of stone. His eyes drifted across the park while he walked, searching the tables for a familiar sculpted face. As he sat down, Mei glared at him from across the board. She said something in Cantonese that his untrained American ears could barely catch. There was a familiarity to the tone, and Tom finally realized she was cursing at him. He laughed, which only angered her expression.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;_God, you’re adorable when you’re mad._<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;She sighed and moved her Queen’s pawn forward. They sat in a silence broken only by the clink of the marble pieces on the board as they hit the clock back and forth, until Mei asked, “What are you doing today?”<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Tom met her gaze momentarily and thought for a time. He moved his knight to the edge of the board, putting her king in check, and responded.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Not much, I have to buy some stuff from the grocery store though.”<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;She made a conciliatory noise, and captured the unfortunate knight. Almost an instant after she hit the clock, Tom slid his bishop into the center, notifying her of “check” smugly. Mei resignedly moved her king sideways and out of check after a minute of thought. Tom did a double take.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;_Her queen...it would cost me my bishop…_<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;It didn’t take much for Tom to cave: Mei never gives up her queen. Her immaculate reasoning skills were punctured by this childish tendency, never sacrificing it for position, points, or power. Tom snapped up the queen and hit the clock but a moment before Mei’s pawn advanced once again, trapping him in a six-move death sentence. His eyes widened to meet hers two moves later, realizing his stumble into self suffocation. Mei didn’t draw out the drop of the guillotine, slipping her rook across the board as she proudly announced: “Checkmate.”<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;An older man laughed as he walked by, declaring that Tom was a failure for being bested by such a modest girl.
Tom smirked and leaned forward.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“I didn’t see that coming.”<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“You weren’t supposed to,” Mei smiled to herself as she turned to get her bag.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Ok, wanna go shopping with me?”<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Sure.”<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Mei looked up, her voice soft enough to hide in the raindrops just beginning to fall from the grey blanket of clouds above.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“You aren’t going to ask about it?”<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Not unless you want to tell me.”<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;She sighed and stood up, ready to walk.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The pair walked towards Mulberry Street under Mei’s umbrella, passing by the statue as they headed to the grocery store. Mei’s mouth watered as she eyed the restaurants across the street hungrily.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“You want anything?” Tom knew the answer even before he asked.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Well, I don’t want to waste all your money.”<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“It’s fine, let’s just get a little something.”<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;In a matter of minutes they could be found sitting across from each other yet again, this time inside a dumpling shop, devouring their bowls of pure flavor.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“I’ll be right back.”<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Mei arose as Tom suddenly stood to leave.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Wait–”<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Tom left Mei standing in the shop, trapped with her thoughts and no umbrella.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;_I don’t want to tell him. I really should, but we’re having such a good time. I can’t._<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;She looked around the room aimlessly. She was contemplating one of the porcelain cats when she lost control and doubled over. Her hand fell to the table as she struggled to maintain her balance.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;_Smell the flowers, blow out the candle. Smell the flowers, blow out the candle._<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;She breathed deeply and tenderly straightened herself back up before she noticed a concerned waitress staring at her.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Mei murmured an apology and assured the woman she was fine, then sat placidly at the booth, only reddened cheekbones betraying her panic.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;He returned with a hand behind his back.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Finally. What took you so long?”<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“I just wanted to give you...this!” His hand emerged, holding a crimson peony in full bloom.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Awww, thank you.”<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;_Okay, now I should really tell him._<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Mei opened her mouth and looked up.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;_Nope. Not happening._<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Do you need something?” Tom looked at her with a smile in his eyes.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Nevermind,” she mumbled as she looked away.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The trip to the grocery store that followed proceeded as usual. The rain ceased as they began walking back home.<br>

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;_Ringing. What’s ringing?_<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;A sleeping Tom started at the sound of his muffled ringtone. Some digging underneath his pillows revealed the source–– a call from an unknown number.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Hello?”<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Hello. Is this Thomas Grange?”<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Yeah, who is this?”<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“This is the Charles B. Wang Medical Center; a patient has asked for you.”<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Who?”<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Mei Wu.”<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Tom sat up.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Wha– Ok.”<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;He grabbed his coat and yelled that he was leaving.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;_Patient? Why’s she a patient?_<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Glass and steel greeted him as he approached the hospital. The receptionist, just as cold, took his name and instructed him to wait in one of the stiff chairs.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;_You would think a hospital would have more ergonomic chairs._<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Tom chuckled at his own joke as he sat down, surrounded by no one, staring at the clock as the bold 6:32 flashed at him.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;_Nothing that bad could’ve happened. Right?? Well if she’s here she must be hurt, or something. Why am I here? Wouldn’t her mom be here? I wonder when I’ll be able to see her._<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;What seemed like hours crawled by, and a nurse eventually fetched Tom from the waiting room. He took a deep breath before opening the door he was directed to. Mei’s mother sat in the corner, head lowered, but Tom couldn’t take his eyes off of Mei’s pale face, rosy cheeks, the milky tube covering her mouth. More of them sprouted from her arms, and the rest of her was covered in a faded blue polka dotted cloth.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“What happened?” Tom lifted his gaze to Mrs. Wu’s bloody face.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Her condition has gotten worse. She will be staying here for a while.” Her accent was prominent in her grief.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;_Her condition??_<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The nurse entered, checked on Mei’s vitals, and explained to Tom how Mei’s brain had accelerated its degeneration, how Mei likely had limited time left.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Tom nodded, barely comprehending a word.<br>

<center>***</center>

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Warm tears traveled down Tom’s face among the freezing raindrops. <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Looking up at the serene face of Sun Yat-sen, he saw himself up the stairs and out of the park. Noticing he was four minutes behind schedule, he picked up the pace. <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;_This is no time to cry._<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The familiar tinkling of bells could be heard as Tom entered the dumpling shop.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Hey Tom, the usual?” The familiar waitress prepared to send in his order.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Yeah, maybe just add a little something to spice it up. I’ll be right back.”<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The waitress left as Tom exited the shop and headed to the florist. He returned, peony in hand, and picked up his food. <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Securing the food in the passenger seat, Tom cautiously drove to the hospital.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;As he entered Mei’s room, his broad smile was met with a blank stare. He set down the food.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Hi Mei.”<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;He thought he saw a spark of recognition in her dark eyes, sitting still above her now sunken cheeks.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Look, I brought your favorite, chicken and dumplings. And today they gave us some prawns too.” His voice broke.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;His composure returned with a deep breath. He began to feed her the soup, taking scarce bites in between. He talked to her while he did: how his day was, the new guitar he wanted to buy, how his last chess game went.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Remember our last game, Mei? I can’t believe you let me take your queen. I guess you won in the end though. Yeah, you won in the end.” The tears threatened to spill over again.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“I can’t believe this is our last day together. We’ve had so much fun. Who will be there to discipline me now?” Tom spoke and spoke knowing his words only hit the wall and fell back onto him.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“I don’t know why this happened to you. You don’t deserve it. It should’ve been me. I don’t know how, but it should’ve been,” he paused for a breath.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“I’m going to miss you so much. More than you could ever know.” He whispered to her motionless body. He looked in her milky eyes, and kissed her forehead.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;He gathered all the food and was about to leave when the nurse arrived with Mr. and Mrs. Wu in tow.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Only family members are allowed for this,” said the nurse, giving him an apologetic look.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Tom met the gaze of Mrs. Wu, and saw a reflection of his own tears. He hurriedly greeted them and left.<br>

<center>***</center>

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Uhh are you good?”<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;_Huh? Oh, moving. Right._<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Tom absentmindedly moved his knight to f6, still mourning the loss of his queen.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;He picked up the one he had snatched up from his opponent, a gleaming piece of plastic. Pondering it, he stared past it to the blackness of his lost queen. His thoughts drifted.<br>
