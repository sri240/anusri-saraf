title: "he loves me not"
---

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;She tucked her thin black hair behind her ear and glanced anxiously across the room, hoping he wouldn’t notice. Stuck in a daydreaming stupor, her mind was racing, concocting impossible scenarios stemming from his message the night prior.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Day after day she waited, frustration building, for a clear correspondence: in the back of her mind she wanted to see him for whomever he truly was, but those radical thoughts surfaced only while she was lost in her own mind. Most of the time, she remained enchanted by the single dimple on his caramel-colored cheek, how the tilt of his smile creased the skin around his emerald eyes, and the sanctuary his arms provided for her, shielding her from the harsh reality of the world whenever she wished.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;He turned his head and caught her gaze, still smiling from talking to another girl, a lock of her honey-colored hair resting on his arm.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;It was _her_.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;She plagued her mind, an inescapable shroud of insecurity and tension. She was too happy. Too loud. Her picturesque face went right along with her slender, yet curvy body. She carried a mildly sweet scent wherever she walked, from the hours she spent working at the pastry shop. No one was supposed to be perfect, yet here she was.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I’m not supposed to care, thought the black-haired girl, I’m supposed to be perfect, too.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;She gave him a shy grin and returned to the empty paper sitting in front of her. The stress from the upcoming art competition had weighed her down in the previous weeks, during which she faced an artist’s block for the first time in her life. Fourteen days. Two weeks exactly to concoct a mindblowing design for the judges. After studying the seemingly alien instrument in her pale hands for what felt like an eternity, she set her pencil to the paper and began a rudimentary sketch.

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Even as their conversation history grew, the girl thought of that message sparingly, as if it were a rubber band that would lose its shape if used too much. Whatever doubt she had over the truth behind the words dwindled as he repeated it. He made her feel special; she craved his attention.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Initially, words had been exchanged, then phone numbers, and shortly after, emotions and tears, tragedies and triumphs.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;They had created memories with each other as the days passed: a shared peach boba tea on the bench after work or some coffee to wake themselves up in the morning; cotton candy at the local amusement park or walks in the pouring rain. On hot days, it was strawberry shaved ice and sleepy picnics by the lakeside. They reserved the hot chocolate and late-night movies for the frostier days that approached later in the year.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;They made each other happy; each served as a refuge for the other.<br>

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Eventually filling the last blank spots on her canvas, she spent her spare hours by the ocean. Time slipped by like the sand falling through the cracks on the rough-hewn pier she visited every evening, when the golden sun just began to dip below the stark line that appeared to mark the end of the earth. It was a far-off dream of hers, that her art could be as beautiful as this wonder of nature. Instead, her art often reflected her unstable emotions; it was characterized by broad strokes of mahogany and bloodreds, spruce-colored skies, hints of juniper hidden in the foreground, umber tints, and onyx backgrounds with shadowy overlays darkening the mood of each painting. The judges called her a prodigy, but the only approval she sought was his. She had saved countless texts from him, complimenting her work, validating her efforts.<br>

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;He ran. Ran and ran until he had left all his problems behind him. He reveled in the bass and backbeat of the music from his headphones. _Right, left, right, left, one, two, one, two_. His music, paired with the ceaseless running, was his escape. Today, though, his therapy served only to aggravate him further. The universe was done with his running: he wasn’t able to take his mind off of her. How he’d fallen for the plain girl who drew alone in the corner, constantly brushing wayward strands of her midnight hair out of her face, he had no clue. Up until now, it had all been a facade.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;_When did it become real? he wondered. I have to fix this._<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Unaware of the artist’s gaze following his figure from the other side of the dining room window, the boy with the green eyes ran past the pastel houses by the beach, slowing to admire the spectrum of colors as the sun slipped below the horizon and plunged the world in darkness. He took his phone out and sent a hasty text, pausing to contemplate the screen for a few seconds, then continued jogging.<br>

<center>***</center>

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Seeing him, she dashed to her art room, taking the stairs two at a time, and hurriedly grabbed the painting and the award. She rushed out of the house, swiftly pulling the heavy door shut behind her, and set out after him.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;She watched him turn left and recognized the path.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;_He’s going to the fountain downtown!_<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Slowing her pace, she patted her hair down and straightened her nylon coat. A few strangers stopped to marvel at her artwork as they passed by, their gazes lingering and causing her cheeks to lightly redden until she was out of their sight.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Turning the corner, she was shocked at the sight that greeted her.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;_The perfect girl._<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Pulled close to him, _she_ stood, looking up at him. Standing across the street, she watched as he weaved one hand through her golden-brown hair and wound the other around her waist, where her work apron was still tied, as he locked their lips together in a deep kiss.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Still holding her artwork, the girl watched helplessly as all of his messages were proven to be myth within seconds.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Not _her_. She could taste _her_ lipstick and inhale the lingering aroma of cherry pie that surrounded _her_. She could feel the curve of _her_ back and see _her_ bright blue eyes inches from her own. She could practically hear _her_ as she whispered his name.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The neon lights of the surrounding restaurants blurred with her tears and the sound of the fountain was drowned out by the ringing in her head as she started sobbing on the street corner. It felt as if the world shrunk down to that moment, and all she could think of were the hundreds―no, thousands―of messages that were all worthless pieces of text on a screen. His deception.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“_Lies_,” serpentine voices hissed in her head.<br>

<center>***</center>

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;He reluctantly broke the kiss, and met the gaze of the one whom he had wronged, only to see the tear-filled eyes of a ghost, skin drained of color, standing motionlessly, holding a canvas turned to the storefronts.<br>

<center>***</center>

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;This time, it was she who ran. She ran past the countless open restaurants and flashing lights from the storefronts, all the way back to the road with the pastel houses, up the creaking stairs and into her room.<br>

<center>***</center>

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The two never spoke again.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The girl never painted again.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The last sight she ever saw was the sunset from the familiar pier, before she was claimed by the raging waters beneath.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;She had gone without saying goodbye.<br>

<center>***</center>

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;That Sunday, under **Arts** in the newspaper, was her name. “First Place” next to an image of him.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The green in his eyes was comparable to the tail feathers of a peacock, and his smile was replicated on his warm complexion as if it were a photograph.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;He stared blankly at the page, devoid of feeling, not comprehending the reality he had tried so hard to escape. He then proceeded to gather his things and begin walking towards the beach.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;A chill passed through him as he picked up the spare key from underneath the windowsill, entered the abandoned house, and walked into her old room.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The canvas lay there, untouched.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;He spotted the cracked screen of her phone lying on the sheets, the last message appearing to be from him.<br>

<hr class="BBB"/>

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; **9:27 p.m.** _I love you._

<hr class="BBB"/>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Now the tears flowed freely. They fell onto the painting, threatening to destroy the oils.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The award rested underneath the portrait, and he lifted it, trembling, to notice writing on the back.<br>

<center>***</center>

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;On the underside of the canvas, hidden behind the handsome face, was the message he had sent her every day whether it was with meaning or not, the message she had obsessed over more than anything else, and the message they had both been fooled by:<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“I love you.”<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Written underneath:<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Lies.”<br>
