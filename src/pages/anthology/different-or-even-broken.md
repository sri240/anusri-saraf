title: "different, or even broken"

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;He looked kind of different, I would say. The thought of talking to him flickered across my mind briefly before his caretaker turned the corner, and held his hand to walk him to the next building.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I immediately averted my gaze, ashamed for staring.<br>
This behavior of mine continued throughout elementary and middle school, but my perspective was altered dramatically when I became closer with the “different” kids.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Whether it was malformed faces and bodies, constant smiles and laughter or unpredictable tremors, it all screamed one fact: they were special.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;My whole life I just tried not to stare: that was the extent of my interaction with them.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;In seventh grade, after switching schools, I was different in my own way too. About a week into the year, the coach called out to form pairs to play badminton. After everyone had rushed to find their partners, I searched and found Michael, sitting with his caretaker. Michael wasn’t very good with coordination, and I had noticed that on occasion, he would get upset over nothing, so I tried my best not to trigger any of his extreme reactions. In the end, I volleyed it over to his caretaker more than I did to him, inducing extreme guilt in myself afterwards.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Following that experience, I smiled at him whenever I saw him in the halls. I don’t know to this day if he even had any remembrance of my face.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The familiar feeling faded after a couple months. I reverted to shying away from the different kids as I became more accepted among the general crowd.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The date on the calendar marking my first day of high school rushed to meet me. Over the summer, my mom got a job. After the first day of school, I came home and told my mom about all of my friends, new and old, and my classes. She told me about the boy she had been assigned.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;His name was Zack. He had cerebral palsy, and was confined to a wheelchair. His time at school would be spent learning and relearning the alphabet, and it was my mom’s job to take care of him.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I learned the caretakers were called paraeducators.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Para, for beside; she was to be beside him at all times, because that was what he needed.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;That night, I told my mom about my biggest fear. I explained the uneasiness I would experience whenever I thought about the future I couldn’t control: to state it plainly, I didn’t want a child who was different.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I could only imagine all the dreams I had for my child shattering in a moment.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Hearing about Zack, I realized we may have more in common that I thought.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;We shared a love for music, specifically orchestral, and I soon realized how important that could be.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;It wasn’t long before I could hear the echoes of my mother’s despair in the cream-colored walls of our home. It seemed that every night she was sobbing for Zack. She confided in me, telling me how emotionally draining it was to be in an environment where she was surrounded by kids who were labeled as special, different, or even broken.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Journeying through high school, it wasn’t long before I became different again. So-called friends turned to strangers, and the despondency returned as I relapsed into isolation.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The internal resentment I faced caused me to reflect on what my mother had said before. Her sadness is caused by the knowledge of the fact that Zack appeared so broken, but I soon realized that inside, I was broken too, others just didn’t notice it.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;As I walked around campus one day, I noticed a poster for a new club: playing music with the kids in the special education program.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The bell rang to go to lunch, and I began the trek across campus to the familiar orchestra room, listening to _Brandenburg Concerto No. 5_, by Bach. Upon entering, I was greeted with the warm sound of laughter and the tinkling of bells. It appeared we were to be listening to _Jingle Bell Rock_ and playing along with rudimentary percussion instruments. I tentatively picked up a maraca and started shaking it to the beat. A paraeducator came over with her student, Sofia, and we sang and danced together. About halfway through lunch, I realized I had lost all of my inhibition; it was the happiest I had felt in a long time.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Now, I get to bring smiles to the faces that I used to avoid. I realized being different really isn’t a bad thing. I conquered my biggest fear as I realized, this wasn’t the end of everything after all.<br>
