title: "fading lights"
---

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;A shadow approached Luther as he sat in the cafe, enjoying the last drops of light as the sun fell below the horizon. The air felt stale. Looking up, he saw Cynthia drawing closer, and his face broke into a smile even before he got the chance to arrange his thoughts. She sat down as she asked him, “How was your day?”<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;He took just a moment before gently responding, “It was okay."<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Just okay?"<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Luther looked into her eyes and corrected himself to appease her— “It was good."<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The conversation died and they sat in silence. The waiter set down Cynthia’s regular, a hot chocolate with double the whipped cream, on the table without a word.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The atmosphere relaxed once they got in the car, as it always did when they were alone. The soft whirring of the hybrid could be heard above the sound of the birds in the parking lot as Luther started the car. As they were exiting the parking lot, Luther paused. He knew the way to Cynthia’s, but didn’t want to drop her off just yet.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Why did you stop? It’s a left.” Cynthia leaned forward to see if the road was clear.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Do you want to go to the vineyards?"<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“What?"<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Luther repeated himself.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Sure? I have to be home by seven, though."<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;He turned right and the air between them hardened once again.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Luther pulled over and got out of the car, and after waiting for Cynthia momentarily, realized she was already on the roof of the car. He struggled to climb up, and Cynthia lent him a hand after pitying him for a minute.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Once he had settled on the roof next to Cynthia, Luther gathered his courage. His lungs suddenly struggled to get enough air. He felt like he was shaking and his head was spinning, but the only movement that could be seen was from the squirrel scurrying across the road. His throat closed and wouldn’t open no matter how much he pleaded.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Cynthia.” He choked. “I love you."<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;She looked at him through already wet eyes. “I know. But Luther, you know my situation."<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Leave him!” Luther hadn’t felt emotion this intensely since his mom had left. In fact, most of it had faded away into his work.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Cynthia, tell me he doesn’t make you feel the same way that I do. We-” He broke into a fit of coughing. “We have something special."<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Stop."<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“You don’t understand. I-"<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“I told you to stop."<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Luther did, and his breathing came rapidly in short, quick bursts. He used his sleeve to dry his face, and he looked up at where the sun had been sitting about an hour before.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Take me home.” Cynthia’s eyes followed Luther as he half fell off of the roof of the car.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The drive back home was a renewal of the silence that had filled most of their outing.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Cynthia entered her home resignedly.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Robert!” she shouted, immediately regretting it when she saw him. He had to have been drunk out of his mind.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Cynthia tried to talk to him, she really did. But the words in a drunk Robert’s mind became a tide, each of the letters tumbling over each other as if they were going to reach somewhere.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;After a session of failed attempts to reason with Robert, Cynthia finally left him, telling him and herself that it would be for good, and without a home to live in, she turned to Luther.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;She knocked on the door repeatedly, but after getting no answer, she tried the handle to find that it was unlocked. Tentatively walking in, Cynthia stepped through the hall and into his room to find poor Luther sprawled out on his bed with the sheets soaked in blood.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;It hadn’t taken much for him to give up. Luther didn’t have much to live for, and he was sure that Cynthia was gone. He figured she might want his cat, Chubbs, when he was gone anyways.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;She let out a silent scream. She couldn’t even bear to look at him. Cynthia’s thoughts jumbled in her head and she fell to the conclusion that she owned the blame. Without turning towards Luther’s lifeless body again, she retraced her steps back outside and called the police. Then, she went to the vineyard.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Cynthia was not the same as Luther, but that didn’t matter now. Nothing mattered now in her muddled mind. This was the place she had practically killed him. This was where she deserved to die. She simply sat atop her car for a while, and then took the little pills out of her purse. She gulped down the entire bottle just to be safe, taking them in fives along with all of the vitamin water she had left. The doctors had given them to her to deal with some problem or the other, and she listened to them blindly; all that she cared about now was that they would do the job. Cynthia never felt the pills begin their work, because she was gone long before any sort of feeling would set in. It didn’t take much for Luther to give up, but Cynthia felt that she was justified in taking her own life. She had already killed the man who meant the most to her, after all.
